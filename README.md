# RC4-Python
A simple encrypt/decrypt Python script using RC4

This is a simple implementation of RC4 cipher referring to Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC4 .

The keys and plaintext are ASCII, the keystream and ciphertext are in hexadecimal.

Plain.txt : plaintext   
Hex.txt : ciphertext  
Key.txt : keys  
KeyStream.txt : keystream  

When running this program, enter 1 to encrypt (convert plaintext to ciphertext), 2 to decrypt (convert ciphertext to plaintext).
